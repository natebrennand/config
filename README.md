#config files

Mostly here for ease of use in transferring config for work computers and VM's.

Also a guide for setting up an OS X computer properly to point people towards so they don't end up with a mess.

##setup

If you'd like to try the config just run `setup.sh`.

If you don't like it, run the `rewind.sh`.
